Collections is a Framework
It is the strength of the Java or Data Structures of the Java

Framework --> Solutions for the existing problems

Then Why we use Collections

Existing problems for the collections is Arrays

1) Arrays are Fixed, Limited to the size, Sequential

Eg:- If we declare array size 100 and we use only one 10 then remaing 90 is wasted

2) Arrays are indexed

Eg:- If want to insert the element in the top of the array

Array biggest problem is Insertion and Deletion



Collections F/W
----------------------------------

No need to specify size
All the collections in java are resizable by default
It has a lot of predefined methods -> To Hold data, Structure data
All the libraries are in the java.util.*;
Collections accept only and only objects
So Here is the point, Primitives are not allowed in Collections
Collections are introduce in Java 5 and on that time only wrapper classes are also intruduced
Most Commonly used collections are List , Set and Map
Collection includes Interfaces,Classes and Algorithms
All the collections are iterable


Wrapper Classes
-------------------------
It wraps the property primitive and called it has an object


Interface
----------------------------
Classes are providers of the Interface

List
--------------
*List looks exactly like an Array but it is dynamic.
*maintains order of insertion.
*allows duplications.
*allows any number of null values.
*List is implemented in ArrayList,Vector and LinkedList classes.
*List is indexed i.e it has positions for all the values.
*Contigous
*Internally using array but how it is dynamic ?
